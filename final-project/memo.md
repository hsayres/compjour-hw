## **Pitch--**

Anyone who tweets at my bot with the hashtag **#feedme**-- and includes an **address** in the tweet if they do not have geolocation enabled-- will receive a tweet back with the name of the **highest rated restaurant near them**. The user can specify **#xmiles**, where x is the number of miles around them (i.e. the radius if they are the center), that my bot searches for a restaurant. The default is 5 miles.
